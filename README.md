# DDL Meeting Schedule

Data Diversity Lab's schedule of presentations, topics, and discussions.

## What?
We host two types of events on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Lab meetings are mostly focused on discussions for topics of internal relevance within the lab. Journal clubs, with invited PIs or students, are used for wider discussions on particular papers or new approaches either in biology or data science.

The full presentation schedule for the semester is under [Wiki](https://github.com/datadiversitylab/DDL-Lab-Meeting-Schedule/wiki).

Below, we include details on the expected structure in each of these events.

```
Lab meetings (weekly)
–	Introduction of new members
–	Funding applications
–	Active discussion
–	Job talks
–	Member-led component
  o	Current research
  o	Relevant paper
  o	Tutorial
```

```
Journal Club (once every 2 weeks)
–	Selected papers
–	Defined during the first week of the semester
–	Led by one lab member
–	PIs and other guests are invited
```


If you are a member of the Data Diversity lab, you are expected to attend to each of these events. We will define the schedule and topics to be discussed in each meeting during the first week of the semester. This initial schedule is subject to change. Meetings will be held on Zoom (maybe Nexcloud talk) and in-person (Harvill 320C). 


Meeting structure can change depending on the situation.

## Where?
The location of meetings will be mainly online, with an option to access the zoom meeting in a physical shared space via our conference room setup in [Harvill 320C](https://interactivefloorplans.arizona.edu/76/0320C) or remotely on [zoom](https://arizona.zoom.us/my/hecdaniel). When participating in a research project presentation make sure to review the lab member's slides before the presentation itself. The lab member presenting should aim to share the finished slides at least 2 business days before the actual presentation.

Note: When discussing scientific papers, the only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
